well that is not what she realy looks like. black nose,brown eyes,gray fur,curled up,legs tucked in, tail tucked in, head out right, flopped ears. now her head is up. now it is back down and to the right. lets look at Georgia. her brown ears are sticking up,there is a circle of brown around her ears.she has white fur with brown spot, a realy small nose that is so cute,herlittle legs and tail tucked in. "junebug. hello junebug. why did you leave. man,you know how soft you are." its 10:06 right now. "man my foot hurts. i should not sit here. i should get a snack. bye june." its 10:12. "crunch crunch crunch. come back little june. realy june. wait has georgia moved." its 10:19. "hi june." there are scraches on the thing. "it is a plastic mat." its 10:38. "Georgia why did you switch? yuck, why are you licking your butt? ha ha ha ha ha ha." Georgia wet down stairs. its 13:10.     nothing is going on. this is just crazy. there is a pirate bull right next to me. "i'll check back in a hour. "june came in. i wish i wish could of told you then."
